# mathematics + code

Hello!  My name is Daniel and I am an applied mathematician, programmer, and electronics tinkerer with a wide range of interests spanning 
physics, electronics, meteorology, psychology, drones and more! 

My programming repositories focus on data science, iterative schemes, custom 
analytical algorithms, and databases.  For my publication on data science, *[visit this link](https://commons.erau.edu/beyond/vol3/iss1/3/)*. 

I am an expert sUAS & RC pilot (multi, fixed-wing, and collective pitch), with nearly 10 years of flight experience.  I used to custom build UAS
electronics systems, see my *[drone business](https://github.com/mathemacode/drone-business)* repo for more!

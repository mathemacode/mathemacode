# mathematics + code

Hello!  My name is Daniel and I am a mathematician and programmer who focuses mostly on physics, iterative schemes & algorithms, data science,
databases, and geoscience / other natural process mathematical modeling.  I use this GitHub as a personal portfolio which is home to all 
of my programming projects. For my publication on data science, [visit this link](https://commons.erau.edu/beyond/vol3/iss1/3/). 
I have pinned a few of what I believe are some of my most interesting repositories below.

I am also an expert in UAS piloting (multi, fixed-wing, and collective pitch), with about 7 years of flight experience.  I used to custom build UAS
electronics systems, see my [drone business](https://github.com/mathemacode/drone-business) repo for more!

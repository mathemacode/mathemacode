# mathematics + code

Hello!  My name is Daniel and I am a mathematician and programmer with specialties in physics, computation, data science,
databases, meteorology, and more.  I use this GitHub as a personal portfolio which is home to all of my programming projects.
For my publication on data science, [visit this link](https://commons.erau.edu/beyond/vol3/iss1/3/).  I have pinned a
few of what I believe are some of my most interesting repositories below.
